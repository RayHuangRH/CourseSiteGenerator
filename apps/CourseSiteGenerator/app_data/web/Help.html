        <p>Course Site Generator is a desktop Java application for creating and
            updating course Web sites. The app presents five tabs. The first tab, site, 
            is for general information for the entire site such as images, banners, 
            pages to include, and instructor information. The second tab, syllabus, 
            provides text areas for the user to enter additional information about 
            the course at hand. The third tab, meeting times, contains three tables,
            one for lectures, recitations and labs. The fourth tab, office hours, 
            contains two tables, one for the Teaching Assistants in the course and 
            another for their corresponding office hours. Lastly, the tab schedule,
            contains a table for events for the course throughout a set time period and 
            the ability to add/remove events. The application saves data to a JSON format 
            that can be used to create Web pages.
