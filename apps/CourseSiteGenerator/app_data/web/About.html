        <h2>About</h2>
        
        <p>Course Site Generator was conceived of, designed, and implemented by
            <a href='https://github.com/RayHuangRH'>Raymond Huang</a>
            for CSE219 a Computer Science class offered at <a href='http://www.cs.stonybrook.edu'>Stony Brook University</a>.
            The application was built in order to learn about making
            user interface frameworks and employs the <strong>PropertiesManager</strong>,
            <strong>jTPS</strong>, and <strong>Desktop Java Framework</strong> libraries,
             created by and maintained by Professor Richard McKenna.<br />
